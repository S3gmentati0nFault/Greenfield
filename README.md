<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this repository is contained all of the code for the project of Distributed and Pervasive Systems by Professor Ardagna and Professor Bettini at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, the project was presented in September 2023. In the README file is contained the analysis of the work I did as well as some informations regarding things that I would like to do in the future to make it better.

In the project we were required to simulate a smart city's cleaning system, we had a set of processes roaming around and collecting pollution data that were autonomously sent to the server, each of the robots had a 10 percent probability of having problems and needing to go to a mechanic for repairs. The mechanic was able to handle one repair process at a time thus the project needed to handle different requests arriving at the mechanic in parallel. The full project description can be found in ./project_assignement.
<h2>Structure of the solution</h2>
The following is the list of all the classes that I chose to implement for this project

- Main
  - Admin Client
  - Admin Server
    - Server Rest Interface
    - MQTT Subscriber
    - Bot Positions
    - Average List
  - Cleaning Bot
    - Bot Services
    - Service Comparator
    - Waiting Thread
    - Bot Thread
    - Eliminator Thread
    - Fix Helper Thread
    - GRPC Services Thread (GRPC server)
    - Input Thread
    - Maintenance Thread
    - Measurement Gathering Thread
    - Mutual Exclusion Thread
    - Pollution Sensor Thread
    - Quit Helper Thread
    - Bot Identity Comparator
    - Bot Utilities
    - Comm Pair
    - Measurement Buffer
    - Position
  - Extra
    - Atomic Counter
    - Atomic Flag
    - Logger
    - Thread Safe data structure wrapper
  - Simulator Code
  - Variables

My implementation is quite thread heavy, but I wanted to really experiment as much as possible with it, to get to know and understand how threads work and how to control them while accessing information together.
